This project was realized for applying to a Data Science job with Wolt, a food delivery company.
Some basic points to make things clear

- Everything I made is in the MAIN NOTEBOOK.ipynb

- I used a jupyter envornment but the  notebook should run without problems with different settings

- The notebook is supposed to show some interactive dashboard on my Tableau Public Profile. In case of problems rendering, you can check them with links or by opening the WOLT_ASSIGN.html, WOLT_ASSIGN_BACKUP.html or the ASSIGNMENT - BackUpCopy.ipynb

- I put a PDF to ensure a more accessible way of opening the notebook and visualizing the outputs.

- All my dependencies are in the dependecies.txt The notebook contains an indicaiton about the ones that are strictly needed
